    "# Predicting references to past and future events\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, the goal of this meta analysis is to predict in-text references to past and future events.  Manually identifying these references is labor and time intensive, so it is impractical to scale up manual tagging to millions of documents.  Instead, we've defined some heuristics for *predicting* when text is referring to real or hypothetical past or future events.  Our approach comprises four main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First we use the `nltk` package to segment each document into individual sentences. Each sentence is processed independently of the others.\n",
    "2. Next, we handle contractions using the `contractions` package (e.g., \"we'll\" gets split into \"we will,\" and so on).\n",
    "3. Third, we define two sets of \"keywords\" (words and phrases) that tend to be indicative of referring to the past (`past_keywords.txt`) or future (`future_keywords.txt`).  We used ChatGPT (`gpt-4`) to generate each list, with exactly 50 templates per list, using the following prompt:\n",
    "```\n",
    "I'm designing a heuristic algorithm for identifying references (in text) to past and future events. Part of the algorithm will involve looking for specific keywords or phrases that suggest that the text is referring to something that happened (or will happen) in the past and/or future. Could you help me generate a list of 50 keywords or phrases to include in each list (one list for identifying references to the past and a second list for identifying references to the future)? I'd like to be able to paste the lists you generate into two plain text documents with one row per keyword or phrase, and no other content. Please output the lists as a \"code\" block (enclosed by ```...```).\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Finally, we use part-of-speech tagging (using the `nltk` package) to look for verbs or verb phrases that are in past or future tenses. After the words are tagged with their predicted parts of speech, we use regular expressions (applied to the sequences of tags) to label each verb or verb phrase with a human readable verb form (e.g., \"future perfect continuous passive,\" \"conditional perfect continuous passive,\" and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "We treat each keyword match (of past or future keywords) as a single \"reference\" (to a past or future event, respectively), and if any past or future verb forms are detected we treat those as (up to) one additional reference.  We then tally up the numbers of past and/or future references across sentences within the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `process_folder` function returns two things:\n",
    "  - `df_results` is a DataFrame with one row per document (index), and the following columns:\n",
    "    - `Past`: the number of references to past events identified in the document\n",
    "    - `Future`: the number of references to future events identified in the document\n",
    "  - `sent_results` is a dictionary whose keys are filenames of .txt files in the given folder, and whose values are DataFrames with one row per sentence in the given document.  The per-document DataFrames have the following columns:\n",
    "    - `content`: the text of the given sentence\n",
    "    - `past`: the number of references to past events identified in the given sentence\n",
    "    - `future`: the number of references to future events identified in the given sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "In the metaanalysis reported in our paper, we only use results from the `df_results` DataFrames.  However, the `sent_results` dictionaries are useful for spot-checking how the heuristics are working, and for digging into results for any given document(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the `process_folder` function can take a long time if there are many documents to process.  We save out the results as pickle files after running the function for the first time on a given directory so that the analysis only needs to be run one time per folder."
