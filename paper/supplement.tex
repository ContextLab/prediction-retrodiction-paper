They made free-form text responses to either retrodict what had happened in the previous segment, or predict what would happen in the next segment. We systematically varied whether participants watched the segments in forward or reverse chronological order, whether (or not) responses were cued using the main characters in the target segment, and which other segments participants had watched prior to making a response. For each segment, we collected several retrodiction or prediction across different experimental conditions. Experiment time is denoted along the vertical axis, storyline segments orders are indicated along the horizontal axis, and the colors denote experimental tasks (conditions).}

Reference rate as a function of lag.} Across all possible just-watched segments (lag 0), the bar heights denote the average proportions of events referenced in other past or future segments. \textbf{B. Difference in hit rates between all events and unreferenced events.} To highlight the effect of characters' references to past and future events on participants' retrodictions and predictions, here we display the difference in across-segment mean hit rates between all events and unreferenced events, as a function of temporal distance (lag) to the just-watched segment. \textbf{C. Hit rates for unreferenced events.} The average response hit rates for unreferenced events are displayed as a function of temporal distance to the just-watched segment. Error bars denote bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals. Panels A--C: colors are described in the Figure~\resultTwo~caption. \textbf{D. Hit rates and counts of referenced and unreferenced events.} As a function of temporal distance to the just-watched segment, the sub-panels display the across-segment mean numbers ($x$-axes) and hit rates ($y$-axes) of referenced (red) and unreferenced (gray) events that participants hit (darker shading) or missed (lighter shading) in their uncued retrodictions (top sub-panel) and uncued predictions (bottom sub-panel). Intuitively, the widths of the rectangles at each lag denote the total number of events at each possible lag. The darker shading denotes the proportions of events that participants retrodicted or predicted, and the lighter shading denotes the proportions of events that participants ``missed'' in their responses.}

      \caption{\textbf{Within-storyline reference-adjacent events are associated with higher hit rates (replication experiment).} \textbf{A. Illustration of annotation approach.} Rather than labeling reference-adjacent events as whether they were temporally adjacent to a referenced event using the original segment sequences, here we used within-storyline corrected reference-adjacency labels. We determined four storylines in the segments used in the replication experiment and assigned a storyline label for each event (shown as different background colors of each event). We then labeled reference-adjacent events as whether they were temporally adjacent to a referenced event within the same storyline (same background colors). \textbf{B.
